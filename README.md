# ICU-Vnc
What does it do?
	ICU-Vnc is a sort of user front end for ease of use with Vnc-Viewer. When you are managing many work stations (for a classroom of students for instance) and you want to see whats going on their screen for whatever reason, just click the number corresponding to their work station. Of course a Vnc-Server will need to be installed in order for any remote access to occur. 
!!!IMPORTANT!!!- You MUST make sure that there is no password required on the server for a client to remote in (Unless otherwise updated of course).
	This application was devoloped to assist my father at his teaching job at an IT private school. He wanted it so that he could either spy on students or help them from his desk.

Features:
-Re-assign an ip address to each button by replacing the ip address on the corresponding   line to the button in the "IP.txt" file with the new ip address.
-View/Control multiple student servers simultaineously.
-In the "VncExe.txt" file you need to type in the absolute path to the Vnc program in the   fashion of this example.

 ex- "C:\\batch\\vnc\\VNC-Viewer-6.1.1-Windows-64bit.exe "

IMPORTANT!! Put a space at the end of your absolute path(The app will mash things together otherwise).
